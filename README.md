## Features

 - 100% of `Memcached` *ASCII*-protocol specification covered
 - Support for storing native PHP variable types (arrays, objects ...)
 - Increment & Decrement support
 - Efficient connection sharing  
 - Configurable connection close behavior 
 - High-quality & stable codebase (following PSR standards e.g. `PSR-1,2,4`)
 - Built on top of good PHP libraries
 - Clean + well documented code
 - Unit-tested with a good coverage


## Example

**memcached-php** covers almost 100% of the `Memcached` protocol specification. The code is clean, full documented and developed following the PSR coding standards (PSR-1, PSR-2, PSR-4). The code is unit-tested and the coverage is > 80%. The library supports \<incr\> and \<decr\> command on stored integers (strings) and the [connection handling is done like recommended](https://github.com/memcached/memcached/blob/master/doc/protocol.txt#L10 "Keep connections open and share them via a pool across instances.") in the `Memcached` protocol specification. Last but not least it supports seven of [PHP's eight variable types](http://php.net/manual/en/language.types.intro.php "PHP's variable types") - in detail four scalar types:

    boolean
    integer
    float (floating-point number [double])
    string

two compound types:

    array
    object

and finally one special type:

    NULL

So `resource` is the only type not supported.

 - Create a `Client` instance and connect it (*lazy*) to `Memcached` daemon on host *127.0.0.1* (on default port [11211])
 - Set *key* **foo** with *value* **1.00**
 - Retrieve *value* for *key* **foo**

```php
$client = new \Clickalicious\Memcached\Php\Client('127.0.0.1');

// Set a value of type float
$client->set('foo', 1.00);

// Returns 1.00 as PHP's type float!
$client->get('foo');
```
You will find a demonstration [`Demo.php` »](demo/Client.php) showing in detail how to use the **memcached-php** `client`.

### Data

`Strings`, `Integers` and `Float-Values` are never modified by this library in any way. Those types will be stored by `Memcached`'s internal system - while all other types will be serialized by this client and can optionally be stored compressed (*LZW*/*Smaz*) - in one of the next releases of this library - targeting 0.4.0. I'm working on an PoC implementation of `Smaz - a short string compression library` (https://github.com/zhenhao/smaz.php) and on a german translation of the translation table used by `Smaz`.


### Metadata

`Memcached` provides a 32 Bit (Version > 1.2.1) unsigned Integer field for meta data. From the `Memcached` protocol specification:
> Note that in memcached 1.2.1 and higher, flags may be 32-bits, instead
of 16, but you might want to restrict yourself to 16 bits for
compatibility with older versions.

**memcached-php** uses this field for its meta data. The meta data is required to mark data for serialization and stuff like this. This meta data is stored via the clients` flags field. The lower first **8 Bits** (*lowest Byte*) are reserved by **memcached-php**. The other 8 Bits (half of the 16 Bits) can be used by your app.


## Requirements

 - `PHP >= 5.6` (compatible up to version `7.2` as well as `HHVM`)


## Philosophy

This client is neither tested nor designed to be used in heavy load environments. It was designed and developed by me as a client library for my [phpMemAdmin](https://github.com/clickalicious/phpMemAdmin "phpMemAdmin on github") project. So I was able to remove dependencies of both `Memcache` + `Memcached` (PECL) extensions - both are designed in a way I don't like. I've tried to align 100% with the Memcached protocol specification. In some cases I didn't liked the naming convention and so I created some proxies. As an example - I decided to implement increment() as proxy to incr() and decrement() as proxy to decr(). I will add some more responsibilities in some more classes like a [PSR compatible](https://github.com/php-fig/fig-standards/blob/master/proposed/cache.md "PSR Cache proposal") Caching proxy and a Pool/Cluster Class for management operations soon.


## Versioning

For a consistent versioning I decided to make use of `Semantic Versioning 2.0.0` http://semver.org. Its easy to understand, very common and known from many other software projects.


## Roadmap

- [ ] `\Clickalicious\Memcached\Proxy`
  This should become a proxy implementation which is able to act as `Memcache` or `Memcached` (both PECL) extension (emulate) for testing (primary mocking/stubbing).
- [ ] `\Clickalicious\Memcached\Server`  
  This should become a virtual (emulated) mode which emulates a complete `Memcached` backend.
- [ ] Add compression support to be able to manipulate PECL Memcached stored data (FastLZ, zlib, LZW)
- [ ] Replace explodes and array operations for data anlysis with regular expressions.
- [ ] Increase coverage and cover (currently unused compression classes) more parts.
